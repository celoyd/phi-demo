# phi-demo

Demonstration code for using the golden ratio to draw, sample, etc., in collaboration with Eric Rodenbeck for his NACIS 2022 talk.

A good starting place might be [this notebook with 1D sampling demos](https://github.com/celoyd/phi-demo/blob/main/notebooks/Image%20stripe%20sampler.ipynb).

This code (in scripts and notebooks) is intended to inspire you to implement φ-based sampling in your own project, not to be directly useful in itself. In other words, it’s a set of examples, not a library. If you base a library on this, let me know and I can link to it.

There are no original algorthms here. Everything is an application of general knowledge about φ (e.g., how to make a phyllotactic spiral), except R₂ sampling, which is [by Dr Martin Roberts](http://extremelearning.com.au/unreasonable-effectiveness-of-quasirandom-sequences/).
